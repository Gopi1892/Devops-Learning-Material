1. Introduction

Definition: Amazon Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) is a cloud service that automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses. This ensures that no single instance becomes a bottleneck or fails to handle the incoming load.
Purpose: The main purpose of ELB is to enhance the availability, fault tolerance, and scalability of applications deployed on AWS.
2. Types of Elastic Load Balancers

Classic Load Balancer (CLB)
Layer: Operates at both Layer 4 (Transport) and Layer 7 (Application).
Features: Provides basic load balancing for EC2 instances and supports TCP and HTTP/HTTPS protocols.
Use Case: Suitable for older applications and simple load balancing needs.
Application Load Balancer (ALB)
Layer: Operates at Layer 7 (Application Layer).
Features: Supports advanced routing features like host-based routing, path-based routing, SSL termination, and WebSocket support.
Use Case: Ideal for microservices, containerized applications, and modern HTTP/HTTPS applications.
Network Load Balancer (NLB)
Layer: Operates at Layer 4 (Transport Layer).
Features: Designed for high-performance applications with extreme low latency and handles millions of requests per second.
Use Case: Best for TCP and UDP traffic, especially when you need high throughput and low latency.
Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)
Layer: Operates at Layer 3 and Layer 4.
Features: Simplifies the deployment and scaling of virtual appliances such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
Use Case: Useful for integrating with virtual appliances and providing transparent traffic routing.
3. Key Features of ELB

Automatic Scaling: ELB adjusts its capacity to handle changes in traffic without manual intervention.
Health Checks: Regularly monitors the health of registered targets and only routes traffic to healthy ones.
SSL/TLS Termination: Offloads SSL/TLS decryption from your instances, enhancing security and performance.
Cross-Zone Load Balancing: Distributes traffic across instances in multiple availability zones, improving fault tolerance.
4. Benefits of Using ELB

Improved Availability: By distributing traffic, ELB reduces the risk of any single point of failure.
Scalability: Automatically scales to accommodate incoming traffic, ensuring consistent performance.
Simplified Management: Reduces the complexity of managing traffic distribution and provides built-in redundancy.
Enhanced Security: Supports secure connections and integrates with AWS security tools for comprehensive protection.
