Installation

Install Docker Compose Using Python's PIP

1) Install pip:
If pip is not already installed, you can install it with:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip

2) Install Docker Compose using pip:

sudo pip3 install docker-compose

3) Verify the Docker Compose installation:
docker-compose --version



Sometimes you may get an error
Installing collected packages: urllib3, charset-normalizer, certifi, requests, pynacl, bcrypt, paramiko, docker, websocket-client, texttable, python-dotenv, docopt, dockerpty, docker-compose
  Attempting uninstall: urllib3
    Found existing installation: urllib3 1.25.10
    Uninstalling urllib3-1.25.10:
      Successfully uninstalled urllib3-1.25.10
  Attempting uninstall: requests
    Found existing installation: requests 2.25.1
ERROR: Cannot uninstall requests 2.25.1, RECORD file not found. Hint: The package was installed by rpm.



Hereâ€™s what you can do:

1) Reinstall Requests Using RPM: You can try to reinstall the requests package using RPM to restore the missing files, and then use pip to proceed with the installation.

sudo yum reinstall python3-requests

2) After that, try installing docker-compose again using pip:

pip install docker-compose

3) Verify the Docker Compose installation:
docker-compose --version
