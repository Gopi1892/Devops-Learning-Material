Create a custom docker image for nginx and deploy it using docker compose, where the volume should be at /var/opt/nginx location. Push the created custom docker image to your docker-hub.

To create and deploy a custom Nginx Docker image using Docker Compose, and push the image to Docker Hub, follow these steps:

Step 1: Create a Custom Nginx Dockerfile
Create a directory for your project:

mkdir custom-nginx
cd custom-nginx

Step 2: Create a Dockerfile:
In the custom-nginx directory, create a Dockerfile with the following content:

# Use the official Nginx image as a base
FROM nginx:latest

# Custom configuration or additional files can be added here
# Example: Copy a custom Nginx config file
# COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# The default command to run Nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]


Step3 Build the Docker Image
Build the Docker image:

docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/custom-nginx:latest .          //Replace your-dockerhub-username with your dockerhub username

Step4 Create a Docker Compose File
Create a docker-compose.yml file:
In the custom-nginx directory, create a docker-compose.yml file with the following content:

version: '3'

services:
  nginx:
    image: your-dockerhub-username/custom-nginx:latest         //Replace your-dockerhub-username with your dockerhub username
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx-data:/var/opt/nginx


This configuration maps the ./nginx-data directory on your host machine to /var/opt/nginx inside the container.
Create the directory for volume:

mkdir nginx-data

Step5 Push the Image to Docker Hub
1) Login to Docker Hub:
docker login

2) Push the Docker image to Docker Hub:

docker push your-dockerhub-username/custom-nginx:latest      //Replace your-dockerhub-username with your dockerhub username

Step 5: Deploy the Docker Compose Setup
Deploy the application using Docker Compose:

docker-compose up -d

Access Nginx:
Open your web browser and go to http://localhost. You should see the Nginx default page.
Summary
You created a custom Docker image for Nginx.
You pushed the image to Docker Hub.
You deployed the container using Docker Compose with a volume mapped to /var/opt/nginx.
