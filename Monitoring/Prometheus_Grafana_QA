Here are some commonly asked interview questions for Prometheus and Grafana, which cover both technical knowledge and practical application:

Prometheus Questions
What is Prometheus, and how does it work?
Explain Prometheus as a monitoring tool and time-series database, focusing on its pull-based data collection from targets (via HTTP endpoints), data storage model, and use of PromQL for querying metrics.
Explain the Prometheus architecture. What are the main components?
Discuss the components: Prometheus server, data storage, exporters, alert manager, push gateway, and PromQL.
What is PromQL, and why is it important?
Describe PromQL as the query language for Prometheus, allowing users to retrieve and manipulate time-series data to create alerts and dashboards.
How does Prometheus store data?
Explain Prometheus' storage model, where data is stored as time-series, with metric names and labels. Discuss its use of a local, on-disk storage model optimized for time-series data.
What is an exporter in Prometheus?
Define exporters as components that expose system metrics in a Prometheus-compatible format. Common exporters include Node Exporter (for system metrics), Blackbox Exporter (for probing endpoints), and custom application exporters.
What is the difference between push and pull in Prometheus, and when would you use each?
Explain that Prometheus typically pulls metrics from endpoints but can also push metrics using the Pushgateway, useful for short-lived batch jobs.
How does Prometheus handle high availability (HA) and scaling?
Describe the horizontal scaling of Prometheus by deploying multiple Prometheus servers with identical configurations and using Thanos or Cortex for long-term storage and HA.
What is a Prometheus alert, and how is it configured?
Explain how alerts are configured using alerting rules in Prometheus, with Alertmanager managing notifications and integrations with services like Slack, email, and PagerDuty.
What are Prometheus metrics, and what are the types of metrics available?
Define Prometheus metric types: Counters, Gauges, Histograms, and Summaries, and give examples of when each type is appropriate.
What is the role of labels in Prometheus, and how do they work?
Describe labels as key-value pairs that add dimensions to metrics, enabling filtering, aggregation, and fine-grained querying.
How can you set up Prometheus to monitor an application?
Describe configuring scrape jobs in the prometheus.yml file, setting up exporters if needed, and defining target endpoints for data collection.
How do you handle long-term storage in Prometheus?
Discuss how to use remote storage solutions, such as Thanos, Cortex, or M3, which integrate with Prometheus to store data longer than the local retention period.
What is the rate() function in PromQL, and how is it used?
Explain that rate() calculates the per-second average rate of increase of a counter, commonly used to measure metrics like request rates or error rates over a time window.
How do you secure Prometheus?
Describe security options such as configuring access control, securing communication with HTTPS and authentication, or using reverse proxies for additional security layers.
Grafana Questions
What is Grafana, and how does it integrate with Prometheus?
Describe Grafana as an open-source visualization and analytics platform and explain how it connects to Prometheus as a data source to create dashboards from Prometheus metrics.
Explain the basic Grafana architecture.
Discuss Grafana’s architecture, including data sources, visualization layers, the front-end interface, plugins, and the Grafana server.
How do you set up a Prometheus data source in Grafana?
Describe the steps to add a Prometheus data source by configuring the Prometheus URL, setting query time ranges, and specifying custom configurations.
What are some common visualization types in Grafana?
Discuss types like graphs, tables, heatmaps, gauges, and bar charts, and describe how each type can be useful for specific metrics.
How can you use Grafana to set up alerts based on Prometheus metrics?
Explain how to configure alert rules in Grafana, set alert conditions, thresholds, and notifications, and discuss differences between Grafana alerting and Prometheus Alertmanager.
What are variables in Grafana, and how do they enhance dashboard usability?
Define variables as dynamic values that users can control through drop-downs in dashboards, allowing for more flexible and reusable dashboards.
How does Grafana handle user permissions and roles?
Explain Grafana’s user roles, including Viewer, Editor, and Admin, and describe how permissions can be set at the folder or dashboard level.
Explain how templating works in Grafana and provide an example.
Describe templating as a feature that allows the use of variables to create dynamic dashboards. For instance, a variable might select different servers or environments in a single dashboard.
What are Grafana plugins, and why are they used?
Explain that plugins add functionality to Grafana, such as new data sources, panels, and apps. Give examples like MySQL, Elasticsearch data sources, or custom visualizations.
What is Loki, and how does it relate to Grafana?
Describe Loki as a log aggregation system designed to work with Grafana, similar to how Prometheus works with metrics. Explain how it allows users to visualize and correlate logs with Grafana dashboards.
How do you use transformations in Grafana?
Explain that transformations process and manipulate data after it’s retrieved from a data source, allowing users to filter, join, or calculate new values before visualization.
How do you troubleshoot performance issues in Grafana?
Discuss checking query execution times, optimizing PromQL queries, limiting the number of data points, adjusting dashboard refresh rates, and monitoring Grafana server health.
What is a Grafana panel, and how is it configured?
Explain that panels are visual elements in Grafana, configured individually to represent data with different visualizations, queries, and settings.
How can Grafana dashboards be shared?
Describe sharing options, such as providing direct dashboard links, exporting JSON configurations, creating snapshots, or embedding dashboards in web applications.
What are some common performance tuning tips for Grafana?
Discuss tips like optimizing data sources, using lower refresh rates, applying query limits, leveraging caching, and reducing dashboard complexity.
Scenario-Based Questions
If you notice high latency on your Prometheus server, how would you troubleshoot it?
How would you create an alert in Prometheus to notify you when a service is down?
Your Grafana dashboard is showing delayed data from Prometheus. What steps would you take to resolve this?
Explain how you would monitor a Kubernetes cluster using Prometheus and Grafana.
Describe how you would handle a situation where multiple Prometheus servers are required for scaling. How would you integrate them into Grafana?
These questions test both the candidate's understanding of Prometheus and Grafana, as well as their practical experience in configuring, optimizing, and troubleshooting these tools in real-world environments.
