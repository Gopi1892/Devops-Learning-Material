Step 1: Ensure Ansible is Installed
If you havenâ€™t installed Ansible yet, follow the previous steps to install it on your EC2 instance.

Step 2: Create a Directory for Ansible Playbooks
First, create a directory to hold your playbooks:

mkdir ~/ansible-playbooks
cd ~/ansible-playbooks

Step 3: Create the Ansible Playbook
Create a new playbook file named nginx.yml:

Step 4: Run the Ansible Playbook
Execute the playbook to install Nginx:

ansible-playbook nginx.yml

Step 5: Verify Nginx Installation
After the playbook runs successfully, you can verify that Nginx is installed and running:

Check Nginx status:

sudo systemctl status nginx

Access Nginx in a Web Browser:
Open a web browser and enter your EC2 instance's public IP address:

http://YOUR_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP

You should see the custom HTML page you created in the playbook:
Hello, Ansible is successfully installed!
This page is served by Nginx on an EC2 instance.
